            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It invites not our knee, but our eye; not our Obſervance, but our Obſervation; or if perchance our Obſervance, not our Devotion: Though we honour Saints, we doe them no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and though ſometimes wee ſing of, we ſing not unto them; wee ſing of their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> not of their <hi>Power;</hi> and in ſo ſinging, we ſing unto God; Sing firſt of his <hi>Power,</hi> that he hath made them ſuch Champions for Him; and then, Sing aloud of his Mercy, that they were ſuch Lights unto us. And here, what danger of Idolatry? what colour for Offence? what ground for Cavill or exception?

                  <p>Thus at length, the Atheiſt and Infidell we have huſh'd, and all their Cavills examin'd and reſuted; let's now heare the Chriſtian ſpeake, what Dialect he uſes, how he ſings of the Power
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18701:76"/> of his Creator. He enquires not ſo much what GOD can doe, as admires what he hath done, and ſtill doth. In divine Myſteries, he thinkes it ſafer to beleeve, than to diſcuſſe; and to exerciſe the ſolidity and vigour of his Faith, than any <hi>Acumen</hi> and Pregnancy of his reaſon. And here is enough to employ all his faculties, imbarque the whole man, ſet all the engines and wheeles both of Soule and Spirit running, and turne them in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſpeculations. Whatſoever is above him, or below him; without him, or with in him; is a fit object of Gods Power, and his owne wonder. <hi>When I conſider</hi> (ſaith our Prophet) <hi>the Heavens, the worke of thy fingers, the Moone and Stars which thou haſt ordained, Lord, what is man?</hi> Pſal. 8. What is man? Nay, How is he? Surely like one in a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or a dreame; for as he that dreameth hath his fancie ſometimes diſturb'd with ſtrange objects, which are rather repreſented, than judg'd of; ſo in the view of thoſe celeſtiall bodies, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative man ſtands (as it were) planet-ſtruck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in his intellectualls, whilſt he conſiders the Heavens, he loſes them; and that Moone and thoſe Stars which ſhould enlighten, dazzle him. The finger of God in them he doth acknowledge, but not diſcover; he made them by his power, he confeſſes he ordain'd them, but how he ordain'd or made them ſo; his apprehenſion is at a ſtand or bay, and tranſported beyond meaſure, cries out with that afflicted <hi>Penitent,</hi>

Scarce a place where he diſplaies the Enſignes of his Power, but man ſeemes to hang out his flag of Defiance, or at leaſt of Provocation; and though he hath no ſtrength to conquer, yet he hath a will to affront; If he cannot batter his Fort, he will be playing on his Trenches; anger his God, though not wound him.

There is nothing in God <hi>majus</hi> or <hi>minus;</hi> His at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, as I tolde you, are himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make one leſſe or greater then another, were to make God leſſe or greater then himſelfe. God is <hi>ſumme ſimpliciſsimus,</hi> not only one but very oneneſſe, and therefore whatſoever is in himſelfe muſt be himſelfe, and if himſelfe, therefore infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, infiinite, then his juſtice as well as mercy, and all his attributes as either; and yet though mercy and juſtice as they are referr'd to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18701:95"/> God, may bee ſtyled infinite, and are; yet in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his workes, they have ſuch a reaſon of their magnitude, as the worke it ſelfe is either proceeding from mercy or juſtice. And therefore when God ſuffers ſinnes to paſſe by <hi>unpuniſhed</hi> (as ſometimes hee does) hee is ſayd to bee exceeding <hi>mercifull;</hi> But when hee doth ſcourge a little, his juſtice was not home to the deſert of the offender, ſo that his mercy is ſaid to be greater than his juſtice (though both be infinite) becauſe in his workes <hi>Ad extra,</hi> he doth more uſe mercy in forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, than juſtice in puniſhing offences. Thus, <hi>Miſericordia Dei plena eſt terra,</hi> Pſal. 119.64. The Earth is full of the mercy of the Lord, and it need be full, the mercifull Lord knowes, for the earth wants it, miſerably wants it; And <hi>Domine in coelo miſericordia tua,</hi> Pſal 36.5. Thy mercy is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alſo; Heaven is full of it, and yet heaven ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanted it, for there is no miſery, but fulneſſe of joy for evermore. And are Heaven and Earth thus <hi>full</hi> of his mercy? where then doth his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice raigne? in both theſe, but that his mercy is, ſometimes, ſuperintendent, and ſo doth qualify the other, though not impaire it. When juſtice is at the barre, mercy interpoſeth, ventures on the very ſeate of judgement, and not only ſits by it, but (ſometimes, in reſpect of man) over it. It doth mellow and ſweeten juſtice, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the acrimony and ſharpneſſe of it. Gods threatnings, I confeſſe, have ſometimes a fearful browe, and like a ſkie troubled &amp; flak'd with red, intimate fire and bloud, but ſcatter none; They
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18701:95"/> are ſparkles perchance of his indignation, but not coales; ſent onely to menace, not to deſtroy: Or if his vengeance once begin to kindle indeed, ſo that from his Throne proceed <hi>Haileſtones</hi> and <hi>coales of fixe, lightnings</hi> and <hi>hot thunderbolts,</hi> yet his <hi>mercies</hi> are ſtill ſprinkled on thoſe flames, and the very dregs of the cup of Gods ſury are temper'd with ſome compaſſion; nay, God is ſeldome ſeene in any of his workes or his Attributes, but <hi>mercy</hi> is there either as an agent or looker on; <hi>Mercy</hi> in his <hi>goodneſſe, fortitude, providence, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Power,</hi> nay in his very <hi>juſtice.</hi> To bee <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice, mercifull</hi> and <hi>mercy, juſt</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> are one with God <hi>Eſſentiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> though not <hi>Denominativè; Concretes</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts</hi> alter not the God-head, but are the ſame in ſubſtance, though not denomination; And therefore, whereas ſome workes of his are ſaid to be of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> others of <hi>Mercy, Non diverſitas ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centis, ſed varietas ſenſuum &amp; effectuum in creaturis monſtratur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lombard,</hi> there is no diverſitie expreſs'd of the thing ſignified by the words, but the variety of ſences and effects manifeſted in the Creatures.

                  <p>Thus, after ſome ſtrugling with the words, we have brought Soule &amp; Breath, &amp; ſpirit in one, and this Spirit in the wiſe Prophet following the true God: It is time now to looke backe unto the Text, and there view the fooliſh Prophet lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the true God, and following his owne Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Vae Prophetis inſipientibus, Woe to the fooliſh Prophet which followes his owne Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what is that Spirit which he followes? By Spirit no doubt are underſtood the corrupt thoughts and imaginations of the Heart; For, what in the 2. verſe of this chapter was call'd <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of their owne heart,</hi> is in the Text here, <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their owne Spirit.</hi> And indeed in the naturall man, Spirit and Imagination are al one in eſſence, though in action and vertue diverſe, the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the formes and images of things with a kinde of paſſion and impreſſion of the ſoule, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the preſence of her objects, &amp; therefore

And doubtles, the viſions of the heart meerely can be no leſſe then lyes, and therefore lyes, becauſe viſions of their owne, and therefore their owne lyes too, becauſe they walke in them; and becauſe they thus walke in them, they deceive themſelves, and then there is no hath in them. <hi>Truth hath abounded by my lie, to Gods glory</hi> Rom. 3.3. <hi>meum dixit mendacium</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) <hi>veritatem Dei;</hi> Truth there hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, Lye unto Man, unto man properly

                  <p>Thus they play at faſt and looſe with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, make Religion a trick of <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> by which they would delude the eyes of the world by the untruſty promiſes of a faire out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; they are a plauſible entrance, I confeſſe; a pretty front or portall of a houſe, but the rooms within ſluttiſh and unſwept. Such <hi>holineſſe</hi> (faies the <hi>Moraliſt</hi>) is a meere <hi>complexion,</hi> and not a <hi>vertue;</hi> much like the picture of a Saint in a Glaſſe; where the lineaments of Religion ſeeme drawne at a lively poſture, all the ſilent Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of devotion, eyes elevated, and knees ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and hands expans'd, and yet this is but a picture ſtill, and a picture of the greateſt deceit, a vaile drawne over it, a glaſſie one (a tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſanctity) ſo brittle, and thin, and hollow, that with the leaſt intention of the eye wee may at once diſcover the impoſture, and pitty it. And yet forſooth theſe would monopolize all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to themſelves; there muſt not be a motion of the Spirit ſtirring, but where they pleaſe to breath it, as if they carryed the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (as 'twas ſaid they did, at the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi>) <hi>up and downe in a Cloak-bag:</hi> They pretend more to the ſoundneſſe of divine knowledge, than any <hi>Scribe,</hi> or <hi>Rabby,</hi> or <hi>Diſputer</hi> of them all.

                  <p>The word <hi>Catharoi</hi> was damn'd for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke many an age ſince, and yet ſome of thoſe locuſts are now crawling about the Church; and it were well if they did crawle onely, they <hi>flutter</hi> almoſt in every congregation, <hi>Donatiſme, Anabaptiſme, Sabatarianiſme,</hi> in every corner. Thoſe Tenets which were worme-eaten, and even duſted with antiquity, are now again new bruſh'd and flouriſh'd, and thoſe very principles which ſo long lay urn'd and buried with the aſhes of their corrupter Grandſires, are rak'd up againe ſo plentifully, that they flye abroad in the eyes of the multitude, and ſo blinde them; that what of old paſt for a foule Schiſme or Hereſie, hath beene lately preach'd as the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church.
